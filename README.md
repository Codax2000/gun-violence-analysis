# gun-violence-analysis

This project aims to explore gun violence over the period 2013-2018.

## Background
Gun violence is a highly charged and political topic, a trend which increasingly causes conjecture and emotionally charged rhetoric, leading to a loss of logic. This is unfortunate, since cooler heads must prevail for culture and public policy to be properly formed. With this in mind, this analysis aims to explore gun violence as thoroughly as possible, given the data at hand.

## Results
The results of the analysis can be found on my personal website, with the plots produced in this analysis and the accompanying statistical analysis.
To reproduce results, download the stage 2 data from (jamesqo's gun violence dataset)[https://github.com/jamesqo/gun-violence-data/tree/master/intermediate] and place into the data folder. Then, all that should be necessary to produce the plots is to run main.py in the scripts folder.

## Organization
There are two folders, one for scripts and one for data. All data should be retrieved by web retrieval, except for the gun violence dataset. The scripts folder has a series of python files, organized by research question and question subtopic.
